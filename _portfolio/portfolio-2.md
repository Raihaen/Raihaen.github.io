[Check the following repo.](https://github.com/Raihaen/Note-taking).

I made this (and planning to update it) because it allows me to avoid distractions and optimizing for the sake of optimizing (like I do with notion or obisidian).
I also created a custom command on my ```wsl``` Linux to directly lauch it on my computer. I'm planning on eventually hosting it online with a password check to access my notes from anywhere.
I might also add more file formats (mainly ```.csv```) and other stuff, but it won't be very sophisticated.

**Note :** I'm aware there are many better ways out there of implementing this, I'm just trying to learn on the side using this side project.
